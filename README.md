### Installation <a name="installation"></a>
The libraries required for the successful execution of this code are mentioned in requirements.txt. In order to install all the libraries:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Introducing a Dataset <a name="dataset-introduction"></a>
This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. It consists of three files:

1. portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
2. profile.json - demographic data for each customer
3. transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed

### Business Problem <a name="business-problem"></a>
As a part of this project, we will implement a data driven approach to answer the following questions
1. What is the average income of Starbucks customers?
2. What is the average age of Starbucks customers?
3. What is the most common promotional offer and most common offer type?
4. How are the success rates for different promotional offers?
5. What are the most successful promotional offers among different age groups?
6. Who are the top 20 Starbuck loyal Customers?
and
Finally, build a Supervised ML model to predict if a customer responds to a promotional offer!!
